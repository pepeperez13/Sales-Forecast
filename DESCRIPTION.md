# Final Project - Sales Time Series Forecasting (also see the actual assignment)

## The Task:

Forecasting predicts the number of sales in the future. Having the right amount of products in stock is a core challenge in retail. A good forecast makes sure there are enough of your favourite products in stock, even if you come to the store late in the evening.

In this project, you will use a subset of M5 Forecasting - Accuracy hierarchical sales data from Walmart at one store, TX3 in the State of Texas, the world’s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data include item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Altogether, it can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.

If not available, this means that the product was not sold during the examined week.
