# Final submission of the Report

The final submission, which needs to be submitted via Canvas in form of a pdf file, contains the Team report, which covers,

the problem of the Sale Time Series Foresting (please see the dedicated canvas page)
the justification for and the approach chosen to address the problem,
the validation of the approach,
the discussion of the work and
conclusion/future work.
The report should be 12 pages max. (excl. appendix if you need it) in ACM Paper Format. We also recommend that you use Overleaf to write your paper in LaTeX. To simplify the process, we have created a template on Overleaf Links to an external siteLinks to an external site., that you can copy into a new project for yourself (Menu > Copy, available after creating an account and logging in).

You are free to use R, Python or Julia.

The code used for generating the forecasts as a single ZIP-file and the Report must be uploaded separately to Canvas following the format:

TeamXX.CodeFinalProject2024.zip

TeamXX.Report.pdf

The submission of the code is due by Dec, 20th, 23:59, 2024.

Project Paper should include the following:

- (1) description of the dataset;

- (2) the scientific goals, specific hypotheses;

- (3) data exploratory analysis including preliminary plots and summary tables;

- (4) plan for future analysis and modeling.

The written final report is due by Dec. 20th, 2024.

Reports have to be complete but brief.

# Data Analytics Strategies:

Perform adequate exploratory analysis of the data and provide a complete, yet succinct, presentation of the results.
Clearly state the statistical model used when presenting model estimates.
Clearly state the model building/selection/validation criteria used to address the scientific question(s) of interest.
Perform adequate model diagnostics.
Provide precise interpretations of the parameters in your model (or your estimates of those parameters) in the context of the scientific problem.
General Guidelines on the Report
Your final analysis should be presented in the form of a brief report between 10-12 double-columned pages including relevant tables and figures. Your report should be structured as follows:

# Abstract

A brief summary of your findings.

# Introduction

A brief introduction/motivation to the problem at hand, relevant details about the data, additional relevant scientific information from searching the web, for example, and what is to be addressed

# Forecasting Methods

A discussion and justification of the methods you have used to analyze the data and how you went about analyzing the data. Donâ€™t forget to describe in some detail how and why the particular model was selected.

# Results

A presentation of the results of your analysis. Interpretations should include a discussion of the statistical versus practical importance of the results.

> Important: The report should include the RMSE score of your model obtained only from testing it on test validation dataset Download test validation dataset.
> Do not use this dataset for training your model, otherwise it will cause losing points from your project (since we will validate your code and results ourselves).

# Discussion

A synopsis of your findings and any limitations your study may suffer from. Present final conclusions in terms that non-statisticians will understand. Quantitative and qualitative aspects should be discussed. Your report should be succinct and to the point! It should be written in a language that is understandable to the scientific community.

# Conclusions

Highlight key points in your analysis or findings by reflecting on them. Summarize your thoughts and the critical implications of your study. Demonstrate the importance of the insight and creative approaches for framing/contextualizing the research problem based on the results of your study.

# Evaluation of the Report

1. 20%: Soundness/Performance of the Approach (Report the RMSE score of your model obtained only from test validation data. Providing additional metrics is optional).

2. 80%: Quality of the Scientific Report

'Missing' team members and grade distribution among team members

The author list is mandatory. If one (or more) team members did not actually take part at all in the assignment they are to be left off the author list. Emails sent after the submission deadline telling the graders that someone was included on the author list but really wasn't there will be ignored. Authorship, as listed on the paper at the submission deadline, is what counts. All team members will be assumed to have contributed equally unless a student does not appear on the author list. If you end up in a smaller team (2-3) than usual the grading will take that into account, but only if you have a correct author list.

Penalties for late Submissions

As of Dec, 20th, 2024, 1 pts (one point) per day will be deducted up to Dec, 28th at 23:59 in that Canvas allows you to submit it. Afterward that day, your Final Project will receive only 1 pts (one point).

# Last but not Least

Take this as an opportunity for a mini-research project to combine what you have learned in the course with approaches and perspectives that go beyond the course content! Don't be afraid to unleash your innovative ideas, exploring or taking a particular research direction e.g., staying focusing on a particular approach and carry out a deep analysis, or perform a comparative analysis of a new and old methods, and so on. More conservative or more progressive, there is no wrong direction. What matters is the depth and soundness of your analysis! This is an invitation to the challenging field of forecasting. I hope you enjoy it.

Happy forecasting!
